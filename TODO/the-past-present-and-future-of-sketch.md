<!--I was at an Adobe event the other day when someone asked me what my thoughts were on [Comet](http://landing.adobe.com/en/na/products/creative-cloud/comet/229818-notifyme.html?sdid=NYTLR42C&mv=search&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!93823739227!e!!g!!adobe%20comet&ef_id=VWDaFgAABRB1hgVZ:20160111181832:s). It got me thinking about what Comet may mean for [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).-->

在一次Adobe的活动上有人问我对[Comet](http://landing.adobe.com/en/na/products/creative-cloud/comet/229818-notifyme.html?sdid=NYTLR42C&mv=search&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!93823739227!e!!g!!adobe%20comet&ef_id=VWDaFgAABRB1hgVZ:20160111181832:s)有什么看法。这让我想起了Comet对[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)意味着什么。


<!--Sketch and Photoshop have been the tools of choice for product designers, and most designers I speak to today have moved from Photoshop to Sketch.-->

Sketch和Photoshop已经为产品设计者的首选工具，而且大多数设计师跟说我现在的工具已经从Photoshop转移到Sketch了。

<!--Prototyping has become an integral part of product design, and Adobe was doing nothing of real value in that space, until Comet. Adobe also saw a simple and focused design tool like Sketch gradually increase in popularity as a primary tool for product designers, which possibly played a role in Comet coming to fruition.
-->
原型产品已经成为产品设计的一个重要组成部分，但是直到Comet出现前Adobe在这个领域没有做任何有价值的事情。Adobe也看到了一个简单而又专注的设计工具，像是Sketch作为一个针对可能在即将实现的Comet中占据重要位置的产品设计者的首选工具慢慢的积累用户。

<!--My immediate thoughts were that if I were Pieter, I’d be scared shitless. The conversation that transpired around me focused on Pieter, Comet, and how Sketch will fare against it. At the time, I was pretty harsh on Pieter actually, saying that he needs to take on funding and grow Sketch if he wants to fend off the very company he’d already disrupted. David and Goliath, or perhaps now, Goliath and David.-->

我当时的想法是如果我是Pieter，我一定会吓得屁滚尿流。出现在我周围对话关注于Pieter，Comet还有Sketch将会如何反对它。当时，我对Pieter的确非常严厉，和他说，如果他想避免他的公司破产，他就需要承担资金和发展Sketch。David和Goliath, 也许现在的, Goliath和David.

<!--I went on to say that while Sketch had made good progress in the 4+ years it has been out; it wasn’t moving nearly fast enough to maintain the trajectory it needs to maintain its position.-->

我继续说尽管Sketch在推出的四年多已经有了很好的进展。但是它没有足够快的上升去维持它所在位置需要维持的轨迹。

<!--I was aware Pieter isn’t in the habit of giving a lot of interviews so I wasn’t certain how he would feel about chatting with me on any topic, much less Comet vs Sketch. However, when I contacted him, Pieter was gracious and open. Here are some highlights of our chat.-->

我意识到Pieter没有进行很多面试的习惯，所以我不确定他和我聊天谈论任何话题有什么感觉，更不用说谈论Comet vs Sketch了。然而，当我和他交流的时候，Pieter是亲切而又开朗的。下面是我们聊天的一些亮点。

<!--**How would you describe Sketch to our parents?  **  -->
<!--It’s very difficult to explain to my parents exactly what Sketch is. To me, it’s fundamentally a drawing app for digital design. It’s not _just_ a drawing app, nor is it _just_ a photo editor. It uses these tools among many others to let you expand and refine the product you hope to produce—to best represent you artistically and creatively. It also strives to not limit you by the design tools you have available. It’s a great question. Geoff, how would you describe what it does? Because after all these years I still don’t really have a concise or thorough way to describe it.-->

**你怎么向我们的父母那代人描述Sketch？**  
向我的父母解释Sketch是什么是非常困难的。对于我，它是一个基础的针对数字化设计的应用。它不 _仅仅_ 是个绘图的应用，也不 _仅仅_ 是个图片的编辑器。它使用这些以及其他很多工具去让你扩展和细化你希望最能代表你的艺术性和创造性的产品。它也同时力争不让你被你能获得的设计工具所限制。这是个很棒的问题。Geoff，你如何去描述它所做的？因为在这些年之后，我仍然没有一个简明的或彻底的方式来形容它。


<!--**Ha! I didn’t think about answering this question myself. Do you think you could describe it as a design application that helps you design applications?  
 **Yes! We set out to build it for websites and icons, then it became popular for design applications when those became more popular. That was basically the idea.
-->

**哈，我自己没有考虑过这个问题的答案。你认为可以把它描述成一个帮助你应用的设计应用？**    
是的！我们开始是为了网站和图标制作Sketch，之后当它所设计的应用越来越流行的时候，它也随之流行起来。那是最初的想法。

<!--**When you set out to create it, is that what you intended it to be?  
 **Yes, for websites, apps and icons. That was basically the idea.-->

**当你着手设计它的时候，现在的Sketch是你所希望的样子么？**  
是的，为了网站、应用、和图标。那是最初的想法。

<!--**Do you feel you’ve been successful?  
 **I think we have. We built an application exactly for those purposes we set out to do, so to me I suppose that’s some level of success.-->
 
**你认为你已经成功了么？**  
我想我们已经成功了。我们做出来能满足我们最初目标的应用，对于我来说这已经是某种意义上的成功了。

<!--**What does the makeup of your company look like?  
 **It started out with just my friend and me, and right now it’s 13 people. A few people fill multiple roles, but I would say 6 developers, a few designers, support, QA and someone who deals with the plugin and scripting community.
-->

**你现在的公司是什么样的？**  
我的公司开始的时候只有我和我的朋友，但是现在有了13个人了。一些员工在公司同时干多种工作，但是我想说6个开发者，几个设计师，技术支持，测试还有一些人编写插件和脚本。

<!--**What do you want for your employees?  
**That’s a good question. I would hope that they have a sense of pride from building the application, pride to say that they work on Sketch. Everybody is completely remote. The first developer we brought on lives in Hebrides, an island off the coast of Scotland. Needless to say, it’s not what you’d call a really tight physical office culture. We don’t see each other every day, nor do we eat lunch together. It’s quite the opposite — we only see each other once or twice a year. It’s a bit of a different dynamic than you might expect compared to other companies like ours. Ultimately, I would like them to enjoy the work the are doing. I want them to feel challenged by the different and difficult issues that we have to solve. I think there are plenty of areas with enough challenges to keep them interested. I definitely don’t want to work them to death, so I want them to feel balanced.-->

**你对你的员工有什么希望？**  
这是一个好问题。我希望他们有对做出这个产品的自豪感，能自豪地说他们为了Sketch工作。每个员工所在的地方之间都特别偏远。我们找的第一个开发者生活在苏格兰海岸外一个名叫赫布里底群岛的小岛。不用说，这不是你所称的紧实而实际的办公室文化。我们每天都看不见对方，也不在一起吃午餐。正相反，我们一年只能见一次或者两次。我们相比于其他像我们这样的公司是有些不同并且更有活力的。最后我希望他们能够享受他们正在做的事情。我希望他们在处理不同的困难的问题时能够感受挑战性。我觉得有很多有足够的挑战的领域能保持他们的兴趣。我绝对不希望他们工作到死，所以我想让他们感到平衡。

<!--**What advantages does being located outside the valley offer?  
**There are many benefits that come from being in the Valley. Access to investors is easier in the Valley, less so outside. But, the fact that I’m physically far away has not been an issue because I like being outside the bubble.

I’ve always had this idea that the Valley is a bit self obsessed. I think having an outside perspective is definitely useful. I’ve of course travelled there a number of times. Everybody you speak to seems to be doing something with software or design and I appreciate that in my normal, day-to-day life. By not being there, I avoid immersion in those types of self-referential conversations—I’m in a completely different world.

The fact that I’m not in the Valley also means that I don’t have to pay your very high rents and other premium costs of living. Another advantage I see is the fact that we’re completely remote. It means we don’t necessarily have to compete with those who need to live physically there. We can hire people who are perfectly happy living on an island off the coast of Scotland and just hire them because they are good and wouldn’t require—or even want to—move to San Francisco, or Amsterdam, or wherever.-->

**不在硅谷工作有什么好处？**  
在硅谷工作有很多的好处。在硅谷联系投资人更加的容易，在外面就更难了。但是事实上物理上的距离并不是我不在硅谷工作的困难，而是我喜欢泡在外面。

我一直认为硅谷有点自我陶醉。我想有一个外部的视角时非常有用的。我去过那里很多次。和你交流的每个人看起来都在做一些软件或是设计，令我感谢我自己普通的、日复一日的生活。由于没有在那里，我避免这些类型的自我指涉的对话——我的沉浸在一个完全不同的世界。

事实上我不在硅谷还意味着我不用支付高额的租金和其他额外的生活支出。我想另一个优点是我和员工们住的距离很远。这意味着我们不需要和我们住的近的人竞争。我们可以雇佣幸福的居住在苏格兰海岸外一个小岛上的人，并且雇佣他们仅仅是因为他们很优秀而不需要或者说甚至想要移动到旧金山、阿姆斯特丹、或其它地方。


<!--**What have you learned in the last year that will inform this company in the next year?  
**In the last year we’ve grown the company quite a bit — we probably doubled in size. So last year was a good lesson on how to manage more people, and how to get them up to speed on everything we’re doing. I think in the coming year we’ll be able to reap the rewards of that work. Because as you know Geoff, it takes time for people to get to know the code, the way a company works, and all of those things. And I think now those familiarizing pieces are all in place, it will facilitate us getting much more done. It also means that I now know how to manage growth in my company.-->

**过去的一年你学到了什么来推动公司下一年的发展？**  
在过去的一年我们扩大了公司规模－我们可能是之前的两倍大小了。所以说去年我在如何管理更多的人还有如何安排他们快速的去处理我们在做的每一件事。我想在接下来的一年我们将能够收获那项工作的成果。因为就像你所知的Geoff，人们需要时间去了解代码，公司的工作方式，以及所有的事情。我想现在那些熟悉的部分都已到位，这将有利于我们做更多的事。这也意味着我现在知道如何管理我公司的成长。


<!--**What challenges have you faced with growth in the past?  
 **I would say we are still competing with companies with a lot more money, and we can’t match them on that front. Also, people with expertise we need are relatively rare. It’s not easy to find people with the skill sets we require, and also have them want to work remotely. So, because we only hire exactly who we need to do exactly what we need them to do, selection and availability of personnel have been somewhat of a challenge.-->
 
 
**在过去的成长中你曾经面对了哪些问题**  
我想说我们一直和有很多钱的大公司们竞争，并且我们不能和他们正面竞争。而且，我们需要的有专长的人非常的少。找到满足我们需求的人并不容易，而且耀荣他们想要远程工作就更难了。所以，因为我们只招收能够精确地满足我们需要的人，挑选可利用的员工有点挑战性。
    

<!--
**Have you taken on any investment?  
**No, we are completely self-funded. There are no external investors whatsoever.
-->
**你拿过投资么？**  
没有，我们都是完全的自筹资金。没有其他的投资者。

**Have you ever been tempted to take on outside investment?  
**No. I’ve never been tempted. We are self-sufficient and profitable. If I were to take on an investment it would mean handing over a sizable portion of the company to an outside investor who would understandably expect a large return on their investment, maybe via avenues I might not agree an in the broader best interest of Sketch. I want to keep growing the company in a way that I see fit, and I don’t want to have the added pressure from someone who might expect more from it than I may even myself. Plus, with that money, I’d probably be expected to grow at a rate that I might not agree is best in the longer term. Similarly, I don’t want to be forced to hire so many people that we’re not profitable, and then only to be forced to take on more funding. We would probably quickly be expected to go from 6 developers to 20 or 30 — and that’s something that I don’t think is wise at this point in time. So in short I don’t currently see the benefits of taking outside funding.

**你曾经被外面的投资吸引过么？**
没有，我从未被吸引过。我们能自给自足并且获利。如果我接受了一项投资，这将意味着把一个相当大的一部分公司交给通过了解他们会获得很大利润的外部投资者，可能是通过某种渠道，我可能不会同意出于对Sketch的极大兴趣。

**With this type of thinking on outside investment, do you worry that others will be able to outpace you?  
**Well, yes and no. There is always the worry that someone else is going to do something you are not able to. But at the same time I think companies that are hell bent focused on growing can as a result lose time in setting up that growth; including setting up new staff, getting them moving in the right direction, etc. I think with a small focused team you can achieve plenty. I don’t think just having more people means you move faster or better.

**What’s the biggest vulnerability of the company?  
**There is always risk from competitors. Adobe announced Comet a few months ago. This definitely poses a serious threat. The risk with a company like Adobe is that it doesn’t have to be an instant success for them. They can lose money on it for years while they improve it — and they clearly have enough talented people in their company to do so, so I do feel some pressure from that announcement.

I think there are many things that we want to do with our product. Maybe in the last year, progress hasn’t been as fast as I would have hoped. But, as we discussed, that is inevitable when you’re bringing new people on and truly taking the time to get them integrated and up to speed. There are also certain parts of the application that were written by me many years ago that need tweaking because what we’re building now is much larger in scope than what we had originally designed. It takes time to clean up that legacy and I think we’ve been good in the past year about cleaning some of that up, but there’s still more to do and of course that takes time and focus. I’m more focused on that internal issue than the external competition.

**I think it’s safe to say that Sketch is eating into the space Photoshop created and has owned for decades. Will Comet eat into yours?  
**We can definitely do many of the same things in Sketch like building prototypes. So I don’t think Comet can out-feature us. I think the ecosystem we’ve built up around Sketch is a distinct competitive advantage we have that Adobe can’t easily copy, including the tools that integrate plug ins, exporting to Framer, Origami, Principle etc.

**Do you see a convergence of design and prototyping? Or will there always be a need for more singularly focused tools?  
**I think there is a broad spectrum of prototyping. On one end, you have basic things like the original Flinto where you’re tying screens together to visualize a flow. There’s definitely value in that. On the other end you have tools like Origami and Framer where you can go completely wild with very custom animations. You can do really interesting things there. However, I think that’s not something every designer will be interested in. I may be a bit worried that those kinds of animations are going to become as overdone as the skeuomorphic stuff we saw before the days of iOS 7\. I value animations but I think designers have a tendency to jump into new things a bit enthusiastically. If we just look at prototyping. We have very simple prototyping between screens to very complicated transitions between them. I could see the former being integrated into a tool like Sketch, but it’s going to be a very difficult job to build in the type of functionality that Framer or Origami has. You risk bloating the application to the point where it becomes like Photoshop, where most people only use a small subset of features. So I think there is value in having separate applications that do separate things. I’m not sure that we should be trying to dump everything into one app.

**How do you go about making such a big decision like keeping Sketch focused on static design versus integrating prototyping?  
**You’re not the first person to ask me a question like that. We talk to a number of designers in various companies about this type of thing. So that feedback in conjunction with our own opinions about what we want the app to be is how we make those decisions.

**Do you think people know what they want?  
**In a certain way they do. In the last year we’ve spoken to a lot of people and companies and I’ve very often heard “Sketch is just perfect the way it is, you just need to add this one thing.” One person mentions auto-layout, someone else mentions prototyping, someone else mentions data driven design. So often these suggestions sound easy to the speaker, but what they are saying is to take these already fundamentally very complex ideas and then if we could just add just one little thing to Sketch, then it would be perfect. Everyone suggests something else, there doesn’t seem to be any underlying parallel requests or even themes. And many of the suggestions may sound like an easy tweak, but are actually very complex to address. At some point we have to choose and understand we can’t satisfy everyone. I don’t want to make an application that is purely driven by what customers say or think they want. It’s also important to preserve your own vision with the app and not just dump things in because customers ask for them.

**Do you have a set of values that drive these decisions? Do they change over time?  
**I think what we want is relatively clear. I’ve never really tried to write them on a list and say these are our core values and principles of what Sketch should be. I guess we’ve just always made decisions with values in mind but I wouldn’t be able to tell them to you because if I make a list now I’ll probably come up with another list next week just because I forgot to mention a bunch of things.

**Who’s making the most progress in this space right now?  
**I know a few apps that integrate with Sketch like Framer, Principle and Flinto that have all recently made a solid series of updates or brand new apps that I’m quite impressed by. But that’s probably just because it’s closely related to Sketch and that’s what I’m exposed to all the time. I’m not someone who spends much time on Tech Crunch or Product Hunt to find out what the latest is that I should be looking at, because I’m just very busy and interested with Sketch itself.

**How do you know if you’re moving fast enough?  
**I have no idea. I wish it were simple. As I said earlier, I know there are certain things that we need to develop — invisible parts that just need to grow with the new greater scope of the application. That kind of work is never going fast enough. At the same time, it’s complex, so I can’t expect it to be done in a few months. So how do I know if we’re moving fast enough? No one can reliably predict the future on these things. I guess we can only see that looking back. At the moment I think we moving at a good pace.

**How do you balance quality while scaling?  
**That is one of the things I would be scared of in a company that grows too fast. There was a posting on Medium or Hackernews that there are 300 developers at Facebook committing code to their iOS app, and that’s pretty scary. For us, we now have a full-time QA person and we’ve put quite a bit of process into code reviews. I think in order to be effective with peer reviewed code it is important to have developers who of course objectively know what they are doing, and also have just the right level of personal interaction and knowledge that they are familiar enough when reviewing each others code that they can judge its impact.

**Has QA been one of the bigger pain points for Sketch?  
**I think it’s fair to say, yes. There is a mountain of complexity that you open up with everything that you add to the application. Just something as simple as copy and paste. There are enormous numbers of edge cases, including: Where do you copy from? Where do you paste into? Where should it end up in the page? To which group does it belong? Does what you have currently selected play into that? Etc. There is just a staggering amount of complexity in an application such as Sketch where you can basically do whatever you want at any point. So it’s a challenge, for sure.

**Are you surprised at where Sketch is today?  
**I would have never expected the market to be as big as it is. I started with version 1 of Sketch in a time where there was no iPhone or App store. I knew there were a few people making icons and application interfaces in this small corner of Photoshop. I thought well, there should be enough room for a small indie to serve that niche. I’ve been really surprised by the size of this market and how big it has grown, and I think it has surprised Adobe as well.

**Do you think your current flat, one-time fee is sustainable for you to grow Sketch?**  
Well, that term is not quite accurate. We released version 3 almost two years ago, which was a paid upgrade. So it’s basically the same model that Adobe had been doing before they switched to their Creative Cloud subscriptions. I absolutely agree that a one-time fee for an application is not sustainable. I also know that we don’t want to switch to a subscription model. The appeal of subscriptions to the company is high. It’s nice that you always get money coming in — then you don’t have to come up with these big releases where you have to hope that you convince enough people to upgrade again, etc.

Customers just don’t like the idea of subscribing to software. We’ve seen that when Adobe discontinued Fireworks — that was one of our biggest sales days. Adobe’s pitch was basically that you can now switch to Photoshop. And many people said, I don’t really like Photoshop and I don’t want to pay for it monthly, so let me see what else is out there. In the beginning, Adobe introduced subscriptions as an alternative to the normal paid upgrades. Then a few years after that, they switched to subscriptions only–that was another one of our biggest sales days. We could clearly see people don’t like the idea of subscriptions if they don’t perceive a very obvious justification for it.

Whenever you have a server-based product it’s more acceptable to charge per month for something, but if it’s just an app that just sits on your Mac and doesn’t talk to a server and can just do it’s thing, people don’t understand why they should pay again every month.

**What is success for Sketch?  
**I really like working on Sketch, and working with the people on my team. And I see myself doing that happily for many, many years to come. There is no finish line or point at which I say that I have enough money, enough customers, enough success, or that I would get bored with the app, or sell it or something — no. No, I can’t. What I do now I hope to be doing for a very long time.

**What’s coming for Sketch?  
**With the recent exit of the Mac App Store we think that we can push updates faster. I’m really excited to be able to ship the things that we have planned for the new year. I think we learned that the last big update took too long and now we want to keep shipping smaller updates. But I don’t want to say too much, because we all know how that works with software!

<!--_It was interesting and engaging hearing Pieter’s thoughts and hopes for Sketch and where it resides in the space. He remains pleased with the size, scale and rate of growth at which Sketch is progressing. I’m now personally looking forward to more to come from Pieter and his team. While I don’t think Comet is going to be an overnight success that kills Sketch off, I do think it may take a bite out of Pieter’s lunch. One thing I did come away with, is that Pieter is dedicated and passionate about Sketch and that regardless of what competitors do, he’s not going anywhere for a long time._-->


_听Pieter对于Sketch的想法和希望是有趣和引人入胜的，并且长存于空间中。他对Sketch的大小，规模和增长速度仍然十分满意。我个人期待更多来自Pieter和他的团队的分享。尽管我不认为Comet将会一夜成名击败Sketch，但是我认为它可能会抢占Sketch一定的市场。但是一件事我始终坚信，Pieter敬业而且热爱Sketch，无论竞争者做什么，他都不会耽搁很长时间。_



<!--_I am grateful for Pieter’s time and directness in discussing a company he started because he rightly sensed a need in the space. I understand the pros and cons of growing a company, especially one you founded, and it was very interesting to get Pieter’s take on the different aspects of running a lean, completely remote company, and his projections for the future of Sketch._
-->
_我对于Pieter能抽出时间并且直率的谈论他所创建的公司感到感激，因为他明确的看到了未来的需求。我懂得了创建一个公司的利弊，尤其是你创建的，而且了解Pieter在运营一家精益、完全远程的公司时不同方面的表现还有他对Sketch的未来预测是非常有趣的。_


<!--_Thanks, Pieter, and best of luck,  
~Geoff_-->

_多谢Pieter，祝你有个好运气
