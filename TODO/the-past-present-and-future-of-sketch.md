# Sketch的过去现在和未来


<!--I was at an Adobe event the other day when someone asked me what my thoughts were on [Comet](http://landing.adobe.com/en/na/products/creative-cloud/comet/229818-notifyme.html?sdid=NYTLR42C&mv=search&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!93823739227!e!!g!!adobe%20comet&ef_id=VWDaFgAABRB1hgVZ:20160111181832:s). It got me thinking about what Comet may mean for [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).-->

在一次Adobe的活动上有人问我对[Comet](http://landing.adobe.com/en/na/products/creative-cloud/comet/229818-notifyme.html?sdid=NYTLR42C&mv=search&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!93823739227!e!!g!!adobe%20comet&ef_id=VWDaFgAABRB1hgVZ:20160111181832:s)有什么看法。这让我想起了Comet对[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)意味着什么。


<!--Sketch and Photoshop have been the tools of choice for product designers, and most designers I speak to today have moved from Photoshop to Sketch.-->

Sketch 和 Photoshop 已经成为产品设计者的首选工具，而且大部分我今天交流的设计者都已经从 Photoshop 切换到 Sketch 了。

<!--Prototyping has become an integral part of product design, and Adobe was doing nothing of real value in that space, until Comet. Adobe also saw a simple and focused design tool like Sketch gradually increase in popularity as a primary tool for product designers, which possibly played a role in Comet coming to fruition.
-->
产品原型已经成为产品设计的一个重要组成部分，然而直到 Comet 出现之前， Adobe 在这个领域没有做出任何建树。 Adobe 也意识到类似于 Sketch 的简单而专注的设计工具会逐渐流行普及，变成产品设计者的首选工具，这可能对 Comet 的问世充当了重要的角色。

<!--My immediate thoughts were that if I were Pieter, I’d be scared shitless. The conversation that transpired around me focused on Pieter, Comet, and how Sketch will fare against it. At the time, I was pretty harsh on Pieter actually, saying that he needs to take on funding and grow Sketch if he wants to fend off the very company he’d already disrupted. David and Goliath, or perhaps now, Goliath and David.-->

我当时的想法是如果我是 Pieter ，我一定会吓得屁滚尿流。我周围的谈话都是关于 Pieter ， Comet 以及 Sketch 将如何反击的。当时，我非常严厉的跟Pieter说，如果他想避免公司破产，他就需要融资并发展 Sketch 。 David 和 Goliath ，也许现在角色要对换一下。

<!--I went on to say that while Sketch had made good progress in the 4+ years it has been out; it wasn’t moving nearly fast enough to maintain the trajectory it needs to maintain its position.-->

接下来我想说，尽管Sketch 在推出的四年多已经有了很好的进展，但是它并没有成长到它应有的高度。

<!--I was aware Pieter isn’t in the habit of giving a lot of interviews so I wasn’t certain how he would feel about chatting with me on any topic, much less Comet vs Sketch. However, when I contacted him, Pieter was gracious and open. Here are some highlights of our chat.-->

我意识到 Pieter 不经常接受采访，所以我不确定他和我聊天谈论感觉如何，更不用说谈论 Comet vs Sketch 了。然而，当我和他交流的时候， Pieter 是亲切而又开朗的。下面是我们聊天的一些亮点。

<!--**How would you describe Sketch to our parents?  **  -->
<!--It’s very difficult to explain to my parents exactly what Sketch is. To me, it’s fundamentally a drawing app for digital design. It’s not _just_ a drawing app, nor is it _just_ a photo editor. It uses these tools among many others to let you expand and refine the product you hope to produce—to best represent you artistically and creatively. It also strives to not limit you by the design tools you have available. It’s a great question. Geoff, how would you describe what it does? Because after all these years I still don’t really have a concise or thorough way to describe it.-->

**你怎么向我们的父母那代人描述 Sketch ？**  
向我的父母解释 Sketch 是什么是非常困难的。就我来说，从根本上，它是用于数字化设计的绘图应用。它既不 _仅仅_ 是个绘图应用，也不 _仅仅_ 是个图片编辑器。它使用这些以及其他很多工具，让你扩展和细化你希望生产的产品—最能代表你艺术性和创造性的产品。它同时力争让你摆脱那些可用的设计工具的束缚。这是个很棒的问题。Geoff，你如何去描述它做了什么？因为这么多年过去了，我还真没有一个简洁全面的方式来描述它。


<!--**Ha! I didn’t think about answering this question myself. Do you think you could describe it as a design application that helps you design applications?  
 **Yes! We set out to build it for websites and icons, then it became popular for design applications when those became more popular. That was basically the idea.
-->

**哈，我自己没有考虑过这个问题的答案。你认为可以把它描述成一个帮助你设计应用的应用？**    
是的！最初我们就是为了网站和图片而设计了 Sketch ，之后随着设计应用越来越流行，它也流行起来。不过那是初衷。
<!--**When you set out to create it, is that what you intended it to be?  
 **Yes, for websites, apps and icons. That was basically the idea.-->

**当你着手设计它的时候，现在的 Sketch 是你所希望的样子么？**  
是的，为了网站、应用、和图标。那是最初的想法。

<!--**Do you feel you’ve been successful?  
 **I think we have. We built an application exactly for those purposes we set out to do, so to me I suppose that’s some level of success.-->

**你认为你已经成功了么？**  
我想我们已经成功了。我们做出来能满足我们最初目标的应用，对于我来说这已经是某种意义上的成功了。

<!--**What does the makeup of your company look like?  
 **It started out with just my friend and me, and right now it’s 13 people. A few people fill multiple roles, but I would say 6 developers, a few designers, support, QA and someone who deals with the plugin and scripting community.
-->

**你现在的公司是什么样的？**  
我的公司开始的时候只有我和我的朋友，但是现在有了13个人了。一些员工在公司同时干多种工作，我们有6个开发者，几个设计师，技术支持，测试，还有一些人编写插件和脚本。

<!--**What do you want for your employees?  
**That’s a good question. I would hope that they have a sense of pride from building the application, pride to say that they work on Sketch. Everybody is completely remote. The first developer we brought on lives in Hebrides, an island off the coast of Scotland. Needless to say, it’s not what you’d call a really tight physical office culture. We don’t see each other every day, nor do we eat lunch together. It’s quite the opposite — we only see each other once or twice a year. It’s a bit of a different dynamic than you might expect compared to other companies like ours. Ultimately, I would like them to enjoy the work the are doing. I want them to feel challenged by the different and difficult issues that we have to solve. I think there are plenty of areas with enough challenges to keep them interested. I definitely don’t want to work them to death, so I want them to feel balanced.-->

**你对你的员工有什么希望？**  
这是一个好问题。我希望他们有对做出这个产品产生自豪感，能自豪地说他们为了 Sketch 工作。每个员工所在的地方之间都相隔很远。我们找的第一个开发者生活在苏格兰海岸外一个名叫赫布里底群岛的小岛。不用说，这不是你所称的紧实而实际的办公室文化。我们每天都看不见对方，也不在一起吃午餐。正相反，我们一年只能见一次或者两次。我们和其他像我们这样的公司相比有些不同但更有活力。最后我希望他们能够享受他们正在做的事情。我希望他们在处理不同的困难的问题时能够感受挑战性。我觉得有很多有足够的挑战的领域能保持他们的兴趣。我绝对不希望他们工作到死，所以我想让他们感到平衡。

<!--**What advantages does being located outside the valley offer?  
**There are many benefits that come from being in the Valley. Access to investors is easier in the Valley, less so outside. But, the fact that I’m physically far away has not been an issue because I like being outside the bubble.

I’ve always had this idea that the Valley is a bit self obsessed. I think having an outside perspective is definitely useful. I’ve of course travelled there a number of times. Everybody you speak to seems to be doing something with software or design and I appreciate that in my normal, day-to-day life. By not being there, I avoid immersion in those types of self-referential conversations—I’m in a completely different world.

The fact that I’m not in the Valley also means that I don’t have to pay your very high rents and other premium costs of living. Another advantage I see is the fact that we’re completely remote. It means we don’t necessarily have to compete with those who need to live physically there. We can hire people who are perfectly happy living on an island off the coast of Scotland and just hire them because they are good and wouldn’t require—or even want to—move to San Francisco, or Amsterdam, or wherever.-->

**不在硅谷工作有什么好处？**  
公司选址在硅谷有很多好处。拜访投资人更加容易，在谷外就比较难。但是，事实上距离不是问题，因为我喜欢远离投资圈。

我一直认为硅谷有点自我陶醉了。我认为有个旁观者的视角是很有用的。我已经去那里很多次了。每个与你交流的人看上去都做着软件或设计工作，这让我感激我平凡又日复一日的生活。由于不在那里，我免于沉浸在自我陶醉的对话中——我处在一个完全不同的世界。

事实上我不在硅谷还意味着我不用支付高额的租金和其他额外的生活支出。我想另一个优点是我和员工们住的距离很远。这意味着我们不需要和我们住的近的人竞争。我们可以雇佣幸福的居住在苏格兰海岸外一个小岛上的人，并且雇佣他们仅仅是因为他们很优秀而不需要他们搬家到旧金山、阿姆斯特丹、或其它地方。


<!--**What have you learned in the last year that will inform this company in the next year?  
**In the last year we’ve grown the company quite a bit — we probably doubled in size. So last year was a good lesson on how to manage more people, and how to get them up to speed on everything we’re doing. I think in the coming year we’ll be able to reap the rewards of that work. Because as you know Geoff, it takes time for people to get to know the code, the way a company works, and all of those things. And I think now those familiarizing pieces are all in place, it will facilitate us getting much more done. It also means that I now know how to manage growth in my company.-->

**过去的一年你学到了什么来推动公司下一年的发展？**  
过去一年我们扩大了公司规模 - 可能是之前的两倍。所以去年我学会了如何管理更多的员工，如何加速他们处理我们做的每件事。我认为接下来的一年我们将劳有所得。因为你知道杰夫，员工需要花时间去了解代码，公司的运作方式和其他一切。我想经过了去年大家已经熟悉了所有，这将有利于我们我们取得更多的成果。这也意味着我现在知道如何管理公司的成长。


<!--**What challenges have you faced with growth in the past?  
 **I would say we are still competing with companies with a lot more money, and we can’t match them on that front. Also, people with expertise we need are relatively rare. It’s not easy to find people with the skill sets we require, and also have them want to work remotely. So, because we only hire exactly who we need to do exactly what we need them to do, selection and availability of personnel have been somewhat of a challenge.-->

**在公司过去发展过程中你遇到了哪些挑战?**  
我们一直和有很多钱的大公司们竞争，并且我们不能和他们正面竞争。而且，我们需要的有专长的人非常的少。找到满足我们需求的人并不容易，而且要求他们想要远程工作就更难了。所以，因为我们只招收能够精确地满足我们需求的人，挑选可利用的员工有点挑战性。


<!--
**Have you taken on any investment?  
**No, we are completely self-funded. There are no external investors whatsoever.
-->
**你拿过投资么？**  
没有，我们都是完全的自筹资金。没有其他的投资者。

<!--**Have you ever been tempted to take on outside investment?  
**No. I’ve never been tempted. We are self-sufficient and profitable. If I were to take on an investment it would mean handing over a sizable portion of the company to an outside investor who would understandably expect a large return on their investment, maybe via avenues I might not agree an in the broader best interest of Sketch. I want to keep growing the company in a way that I see fit, and I don’t want to have the added pressure from someone who might expect more from it than I may even myself. Plus, with that money, I’d probably be expected to grow at a rate that I might not agree is best in the longer term. Similarly, I don’t want to be forced to hire so many people that we’re not profitable, and then only to be forced to take on more funding. We would probably quickly be expected to go from 6 developers to 20 or 30 — and that’s something that I don’t think is wise at this point in time. So in short I don’t currently see the benefits of taking outside funding.
-->
**你曾经被外面的投资吸引过么？**  
没有，我从未被吸引过。我们能自给自足并且获利。如果我接受了一项投资，这将意味着把一个相当大的一部分公司交给了仅仅可能是通过某种渠道知道我们能获得很大利润的外部投资者，出于对 Sketch 的极大兴趣我可能不会同意投资。我想去以一种我认为合适的方式去发展公司，并且我不想去从一个比我期待还大的人身上获得压力。而且，拿了那笔钱，我可能被要求去以一种长远来看我不认为是最好的速度来开发软件。与之相类，我不想要去被强迫去招很多的人以至于我们无法获利，之后只好被强迫去拿更多的投资。我们可能会很多的从6个开发者发展到20个或者30个－在这个时间点我不认为是聪明的。所以在短期内我目前还没有看到拿外部资金的好处。

<!--**With this type of thinking on outside investment, do you worry that others will be able to outpace you?  
**Well, yes and no. There is always the worry that someone else is going to do something you are not able to. But at the same time I think companies that are hell bent focused on growing can as a result lose time in setting up that growth; including setting up new staff, getting them moving in the right direction, etc. I think with a small focused team you can achieve plenty. I don’t think just having more people means you move faster or better.-->

**你对外部投资有这样的看法，你不担心其他人会超过你么？**  
好吧，我担心也不担心。我会一直担心其他人将会做到你做不到的东西。但是与此同时我认为一意孤行的发展公司会耽误公司的时间，包括招收新的职员，让他们在正确的方向前进，等等。我认为有一个小而又专注的团队你能够做的更多。我不认为仅拥有更多的人就意味着你可以前进的更快更远。

<!--**What’s the biggest vulnerability of the company?  
**There is always risk from competitors. Adobe announced Comet a few months ago. This definitely poses a serious threat. The risk with a company like Adobe is that it doesn’t have to be an instant success for them. They can lose money on it for years while they improve it — and they clearly have enough talented people in their company to do so, so I do feel some pressure from that announcement.

I think there are many things that we want to do with our product. Maybe in the last year, progress hasn’t been as fast as I would have hoped. But, as we discussed, that is inevitable when you’re bringing new people on and truly taking the time to get them integrated and up to speed. There are also certain parts of the application that were written by me many years ago that need tweaking because what we’re building now is much larger in scope than what we had originally designed. It takes time to clean up that legacy and I think we’ve been good in the past year about cleaning some of that up, but there’s still more to do and of course that takes time and focus. I’m more focused on that internal issue than the external competition.
-->
**你们公司最大的弱点是什么？**  
总会有来自竞争者的挑战。 Adobe 在几个月前公布了 Comet 。这无疑对我们产生了严重的威胁。和像 Adobe 这样的公司竞争的风险就是他们并不急功近利。在他们改善的过程中他们可以很多年的钱亏－并且他们显然有足够的人才在他们的公司工作，所以这个消息给我很大压力。

我想对于我们的产品还有很多的东西可以去做。也许在过去的一年，进展并没有我料想的快。但是，就像我们讨论过的，当你带来新的人并且真的花时间让他们成为一体、提升速度那是必然要做的。而且软件中还有一些很多年前我写的部分，因为我们现在扩大了原来的设计范围而需要修改。这需要时间去清理并且在过去的一年我们已经成功的清理了一部分，但还有更多的工作要做，当然，这需要时间和精力。我更关注于内部的问题而不是外部的问题。

<!--**I think it’s safe to say that Sketch is eating into the space Photoshop created and has owned for decades. Will Comet eat into yours?  
**We can definitely do many of the same things in Sketch like building prototypes. So I don’t think Comet can out-feature us. I think the ecosystem we’ve built up around Sketch is a distinct competitive advantage we have that Adobe can’t easily copy, including the tools that integrate plug ins, exporting to Framer, Origami, Principle etc.
-->
**我可以肯定地说 Sketch 正在蚕食 Photeshop 开创并持有多年的市场空间。你认为 Comet 会蚕食你们的么？**  
我们可以确实地在 Sketch 上做很多事情就像建立原型设计。所以我不认为 Comet 可以在功能上超过我们。我认为，我们已经建立的 Sketch 周围的生态系统是一个独特的竞争优势，我们拥有了 Adobe 无法轻松地复制的优势，包括集成的插件工具，导出到Framer、Origami、Principle等等。
<!--
**Do you see a convergence of design and prototyping? Or will there always be a need for more singularly focused tools?  
**I think there is a broad spectrum of prototyping. On one end, you have basic things like the original Flinto where you’re tying screens together to visualize a flow. There’s definitely value in that. On the other end you have tools like Origami and Framer where you can go completely wild with very custom animations. You can do really interesting things there. However, I think that’s not something every designer will be interested in. I may be a bit worried that those kinds of animations are going to become as overdone as the skeuomorphic stuff we saw before the days of iOS 7\. I value animations but I think designers have a tendency to jump into new things a bit enthusiastically. If we just look at prototyping. We have very simple prototyping between screens to very complicated transitions between them. I could see the former being integrated into a tool like Sketch, but it’s going to be a very difficult job to build in the type of functionality that Framer or Origami has. You risk bloating the application to the point where it becomes like Photoshop, where most people only use a small subset of features. So I think there is value in having separate applications that do separate things. I’m not sure that we should be trying to dump everything into one app.-->

**你看到设计和原型的融合了么？又或者是总会有对于更加突出关注的工具的需求？**  
我认为原型设计有宽广的发展。一方面，你可以使用基本的工具像是原始的 Flinto 所提供的屏幕可视化流程。这十分的有价值。另一方面你可以使用像是 Origami 和 Framer 这样你可以完全自定义动画的工具。你可以做非常有趣的事情。然而我认为这不是每个设计者都感兴趣的事。我担心这些动画会像前一阵出的 iOS7 的 skeuomorphic stuff 一样做得过分。我很看重动画，但是我认为设计师应该有热情迎接新事物的倾向。如果我们只看原型设计。我们必须在他们之间非常复杂的屏幕过度之间进行非常简单的原型设计。曾经有被集成进 Sketch 的工具，但是开发像是 Framer 或是 Origami 那样的实用程序将会是非常难的。你可能会像是 Photoshop 那样把应用膨胀到大多数用户只会使用其中一小部分功能的样子。所以我认为独立应用做独立的功能是非常有价值的。我不认为我们应该试图把每个东西添加到应用中。


<!--**How do you go about making such a big decision like keeping Sketch focused on static design versus integrating prototyping?  
**You’re not the first person to ask me a question like that. We talk to a number of designers in various companies about this type of thing. So that feedback in conjunction with our own opinions about what we want the app to be is how we make those decisions.-->

**你是怎么做出像是让 Sketch 保持静态设计而不是集成融合这么重大的决定呢？**  
你不是第一个问我这个问题的人。我们和很多公司的设计师交流过这类事情。因此我们结合了反馈和我们自己的想法做出这些决定。


<!--**Do you think people know what they want?  
**In a certain way they do. In the last year we’ve spoken to a lot of people and companies and I’ve very often heard “Sketch is just perfect the way it is, you just need to add this one thing.” One person mentions auto-layout, someone else mentions prototyping, someone else mentions data driven design. So often these suggestions sound easy to the speaker, but what they are saying is to take these already fundamentally very complex ideas and then if we could just add just one little thing to Sketch, then it would be perfect. Everyone suggests something else, there doesn’t seem to be any underlying parallel requests or even themes. And many of the suggestions may sound like an easy tweak, but are actually very complex to address. At some point we have to choose and understand we can’t satisfy everyone. I don’t want to make an application that is purely driven by what customers say or think they want. It’s also important to preserve your own vision with the app and not just dump things in because customers ask for them.-->


**你认为人们知道他们想要什么么？**  
他们当然知道。去年我们曾经与很多公司的人交流过，我经常听到“ Sketch 已经很完美了，你只需要加入这个东西就更好了”。一些人关注自动布局，一些人可能关注原型设计，另一些人关注数据驱动设计。所以经常这些建议对于说话的人听起来很简单，但是他们说的只是采取这些基本上非常复杂的想法，而且之后如果我们可以只在 Sketch 添加一个小小的功能，那么它将会非常完美。每个人建议一些事情，都没有看起来相似的请求甚至是主题。并且很多建议可能听起来是一个简单的变化，但是解决起来都非常复杂，所以我们不得不选择和理解，我们不能满足每一个人。
我不想做一个完全由用户说什么或是想要什么主导的应用。保留你自己的想法而不只是用户想要什么就添加什么。

<!--**Do you have a set of values that drive these decisions? Do they change over time?  
**I think what we want is relatively clear. I’ve never really tried to write them on a list and say these are our core values and principles of what Sketch should be. I guess we’ve just always made decisions with values in mind but I wouldn’t be able to tell them to you because if I make a list now I’ll probably come up with another list next week just because I forgot to mention a bunch of things.-->

**你有一系列的价值观去驱动这些决定么？它们随着时间变化么？**  
我想我们想要什么是相当清楚的。我从没有真的去尝试把他们写在一个单子上然后说这就是我们的核心价值观和 Sketch 应该是什么样的原则。我猜我们只是经常用思想里的价值观做出决定，但是我不能够把他们告诉你，因为如果我现在列出一个单子，我将有可能因为我忘了去关注一些事情而在下周列出另一个单子。

<!--**Who’s making the most progress in this space right now?  
**I know a few apps that integrate with Sketch like Framer, Principle and Flinto that have all recently made a solid series of updates or brand new apps that I’m quite impressed by. But that’s probably just because it’s closely related to Sketch and that’s what I’m exposed to all the time. I’m not someone who spends much time on Tech Crunch or Product Hunt to find out what the latest is that I should be looking at, because I’m just very busy and interested with Sketch itself.
-->
**在这个领域谁的进展最大？**  
我知道一些融合了 Sketch 的应用像是 Framer 、 Principle 和 Flinto ，最近都有一系列的更新或者是制作全新的应用程序，这使我十分感动。但可能因为它们和 Sketch 相关并且我一直关注的原因，所以我才会有这样的想法。
我不会消耗很多时间在 Tech Crunch 或 Product Hunt 上去寻找我应该关注的最新的项目，因为我非常的忙，并且对 Sketch 非常感兴趣。

<!--**How do you know if you’re moving fast enough?  
**I have no idea. I wish it were simple. As I said earlier, I know there are certain things that we need to develop — invisible parts that just need to grow with the new greater scope of the application. That kind of work is never going fast enough. At the same time, it’s complex, so I can’t expect it to be done in a few months. So how do I know if we’re moving fast enough? No one can reliably predict the future on these things. I guess we can only see that looking back. At the moment I think we moving at a good pace.-->

**你怎么知道你是不是前进的够快？**  
我不知道。我希望那能简单一点。就像我说最初，我只知道有一些事情我们需要去开发－只需要去更新扩大还没有完成的部分就可以。这种类型的工作从来也不会走的足够的快。与此同时，它也是复杂的，所以我不能期待它在几个月内完成。所以如果我前进的过快，我怎么知道？没有人能对这些事情进行可靠的预言。我猜我们仅能事后回顾。此刻，我认为我们前进的步伐恰到好处。

<!--**How do you balance quality while scaling?  
**That is one of the things I would be scared of in a company that grows too fast. There was a posting on Medium or Hackernews that there are 300 developers at Facebook committing code to their iOS app, and that’s pretty scary. For us, we now have a full-time QA person and we’ve put quite a bit of process into code reviews. I think in order to be effective with peer reviewed code it is important to have developers who of course objectively know what they are doing, and also have just the right level of personal interaction and knowledge that they are familiar enough when reviewing each others code that they can judge its impact.-->

**你如何平衡质量等级？**  
我非常恐惧的事情其中之一就是公司发展过快。根据Medium 和 Hackernews之前的一篇报道：Facebook的IOS应用有多达300名开发人员，这是很吓人的。对于我们，我们现在有一个全职的测试人员而且我们在代码审查方面下了很大功夫，我认为为了让每一行的代码审查都是有效的，开发人员清楚地知道自己在做什么是很重要的，并且他们应该有着良好的交流，相互十分熟悉，这样他们在看对方的代码的时候能清楚的知道它的作用。

<!--**Has QA been one of the bigger pain points for Sketch?  
**I think it’s fair to say, yes. There is a mountain of complexity that you open up with everything that you add to the application. Just something as simple as copy and paste. There are enormous numbers of edge cases, including: Where do you copy from? Where do you paste into? Where should it end up in the page? To which group does it belong? Does what you have currently selected play into that? Etc. There is just a staggering amount of complexity in an application such as Sketch where you can basically do whatever you want at any point. So it’s a challenge, for sure.
-->
**测试已经成为 Sketch 最大的痛点了吗？**  
公正的说，是的。对应用增加需求就像开凿一个复杂的大山。有些简单的像复制黏贴。
但是他们有很多边缘的容易被忽视的问题，包括：你从哪拷贝的？你要粘贴到哪里？它将在页面的哪里结束？它属于哪个组？
对当前的选择在那里你打算做什么？等等。像 Sketch 这样你基本上可以在任何点做任何事的应用其中一定有一大堆复杂的东西。这肯定是一个挑战。

<!--**Are you surprised at where Sketch is today?  
**I would have never expected the market to be as big as it is. I started with version 1 of Sketch in a time where there was no iPhone or App store. I knew there were a few people making icons and application interfaces in this small corner of Photoshop. I thought well, there should be enough room for a small indie to serve that niche. I’ve been really surprised by the size of this market and how big it has grown, and I think it has surprised Adobe as well.
-->
**你会为今天 Sketch 的地位惊讶么？**  
我从未期待过 Sketch 的市场像现在的那样大。我刚开始做 Sketch 第一个版本的时候，无论 iPhone 还是 App store 都没有呢。我知道很少的人使用 Photoshop 的一些小功能去制作图标和用户界面。我想好，这里应当有足够的空间去满足一个非主流的需求。我被这个市场的大小还有它已经扩展了多大吓到了，我想他也同样吓到了 Adobe 。

<!--**Do you think your current flat, one-time fee is sustainable for you to grow Sketch?**  
Well, that term is not quite accurate. We released version 3 almost two years ago, which was a paid upgrade. So it’s basically the same model that Adobe had been doing before they switched to their Creative Cloud subscriptions. I absolutely agree that a one-time fee for an application is not sustainable. I also know that we don’t want to switch to a subscription model. The appeal of subscriptions to the company is high. It’s nice that you always get money coming in — then you don’t have to come up with these big releases where you have to hope that you convince enough people to upgrade again, etc.-->

<!--Customers just don’t like the idea of subscribing to software. We’ve seen that when Adobe discontinued Fireworks — that was one of our biggest sales days. Adobe’s pitch was basically that you can now switch to Photoshop. And many people said, I don’t really like Photoshop and I don’t want to pay for it monthly, so let me see what else is out there. In the beginning, Adobe introduced subscriptions as an alternative to the normal paid upgrades. Then a few years after that, they switched to subscriptions only–that was another one of our biggest sales days. We could clearly see people don’t like the idea of subscriptions if they don’t perceive a very obvious justification for it.
-->
<!--Whenever you have a server-based product it’s more acceptable to charge per month for something, but if it’s just an app that just sits on your Mac and doesn’t talk to a server and can just do it’s thing, people don’t understand why they should pay again every month.-->

**你认为就公司现在的发展，一次性的收费对你开发 Sketch 是可持续性的么？**  
好吧，这个描述不是非常精准。我们大概在两年前发布需要有尝升级的第三版。所以这和 Adobe 选择他们的 Creative Cloud 之前的模式一样。我绝对同意应用的一次性收费不是一种可持续性方式。我同样知道我们不想要用订购的模式。订购的方案在公司呼吁很高。你总是能拿到收入这点非常好－那么你不必拿出这些大的版本来说服足够多的人再次升级，等等。

顾客不喜欢订购软件的方式。当 Adobe 终止 Fireworks 的时候，那是我们卖的最多的日子之一。 Adobe 的定位十分基础，你可以现在选择 Photoshop 。而且很多人说，我真的不是喜欢 Photoshop ，而且我不想每个月支付，所以这让我了解了其他的收费方式。在最开始， Adobe 引入了订购的方式作为一种相对于传统方式的可供替代的方式。在那几年之后，他们选择了仅支持订购的方式，这是我们又一次卖的最多的日子。如果他们不了解一个非常明显的理由，我们可以清楚的发现人们不喜欢订购这种方式。

当你开发一个以服务器为基础的产品时，每个月支付的方式更容易被接受，但是如果这只是一个应用仅仅用在你的Mac上而不和服务器进行交互直接做一些事情，人们就不理解为什么他们每个月都要付费。

<!--**What is success for Sketch?  
**I really like working on Sketch, and working with the people on my team. And I see myself doing that happily for many, many years to come. There is no finish line or point at which I say that I have enough money, enough customers, enough success, or that I would get bored with the app, or sell it or something — no. No, I can’t. What I do now I hope to be doing for a very long time.-->

**Sketch 的成功是什么？**  
我真的喜欢为 Sketch 工作，和我们团队的人一起工作。并且我认为我自己将会很开心的做这件事很多年。并不会因为我有足够的钱、足够的用户、足够成功、或是对应用感到厌倦、或是把它卖了之类的事情而停止－不，我不能。我希望在将来很长一段时间我还能做我现在做的事情。

<!--**What’s coming for Sketch?  
**With the recent exit of the Mac App Store we think that we can push updates faster. I’m really excited to be able to ship the things that we have planned for the new year. I think we learned that the last big update took too long and now we want to keep shipping smaller updates. But I don’t want to say too much, because we all know how that works with software!

**Sketch 将会发生什么改变？**  
前不久我们离开了 Mac 的 App Store ，我们认为我们可以更快的推送更新。我是真的激动地去能够交出我们原来对于新年的计划的东西。我们发现上一个大更新用了我们太长的时间，现在我们打算持续的推送小更新。但是我不打算说的太多，因为我们都知道软件行业的一些规则。

<!--_It was interesting and engaging hearing Pieter’s thoughts and hopes for Sketch and where it resides in the space. He remains pleased with the size, scale and rate of growth at which Sketch is progressing. I’m now personally looking forward to more to come from Pieter and his team. While I don’t think Comet is going to be an overnight success that kills Sketch off, I do think it may take a bite out of Pieter’s lunch. One thing I did come away with, is that Pieter is dedicated and passionate about Sketch and that regardless of what competitors do, he’s not going anywhere for a long time._-->


_听 Pieter 对于 Sketch 的想法和希望是有趣和引人入胜的，并且会长存于这个领域。他对 Sketch 的大小，规模和增长速度仍然十分满意。我个人期待更多来自 Pieter 和他的团队的分享。尽管我不认为 Comet 将会一夜成名击败 Sketch ，但是我认为它可能会抢占 Sketch 一定的市场。但是一件事我始终坚信， Pieter 敬业而且热爱 Sketch ，无论竞争者做什么，他都不会耽搁很长时间。_



<!--_I am grateful for Pieter’s time and directness in discussing a company he started because he rightly sensed a need in the space. I understand the pros and cons of growing a company, especially one you founded, and it was very interesting to get Pieter’s take on the different aspects of running a lean, completely remote company, and his projections for the future of Sketch._

_我对于 Pieter 能抽出时间并且直率的谈论他所创建的公司而感到感激，因为他明确的看到了未来的需求。我懂得了发展一个公司的利弊，尤其是你创建的，而且了解 Pieter 在运营一家精益、完全远程的公司时不同方面的表现还有他对 Sketch 的未来预测是非常有趣的。_


<!--_Thanks, Pieter, and best of luck,
