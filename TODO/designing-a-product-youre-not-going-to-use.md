When I told my friends I design a sports media platform for a living, I got the response “but what do you know about sports?” In my defence, I’ve watched some games on TV and I know the basics, but I’m definitely not a fan, far from it.

I will admit I had my concerns when I started working at MinuteMedia, the parent company of 90min and 12up, because after all I’m an ex-ballerina designing products for sports fans. Sounds like the perfect match, right? Well actually it is.

When I started working at 90min, I knew from the first moment that the product is a great one. Not because of the way it looked at the time, but because of it’s core idea. It’s not just another platform with articles about football, but a place for the fans to be heard. That authenticity won me over in a flash. When I was asked to design our new product, 12up, I knew it was going to be quite the challenge. I had to come up with an upgraded and updated version of 90min. And if that’s not enough, 12up is all about American sports, about which I have zero knowledge. How can I take our good product and mercilessly tear it to pieces to understand what works and what does not? And how do I present my conclusions to those who put their heart and soul into building 90min, driving home on those painful points? If I told you that this process was easy, it would be a big fat lie. It took a lot of hard work, a ton of sketches and a few design blocks to be a part of this rewarding and truly amazing process.

I’m sure some of you have had your own concerns about taking on projects like this, so I’d like to share some tips from my experience.

#### If you don’t know something just ask

There’s no shame in not knowing something, we can’t be experts about everything. Yeah I know, asking questions is important in any design process, but when you’re not the user type for the product, it’s important to speak up. Asking questions is the first step to understanding the problem you’re trying to solve. If you don’t know everything about the problem how are you going to try and solve it? So be a pain in the ass and ask about anything, even if people will raise an eyebrow when you ask ‘how long is a baseball game?’ (true story)

#### There is no ‘I’ in USER

We all do it sometimes; “I wouldn’t click that”, “I understand it perfectly”, we only think how _we_ would interact with the interface . There’s you and there’s the user, and you are designing for the USER. I’m not perfect, I’ve done it also. I had debates with our VP of Product about certain features that ended with him telling me “but you are not the user”. Sometimes it’s hard to let go of something you created (especially if you’ve fallen in love with it already), but it’s giving it up for the greater good. Sometimes we just need to get this one idea out of our system, so do it and then just let it go. After you’re done with that, try to think about your personas, they exist for a reason. You’ll be amazed how liberating it is to design for someone not as perfectionist and stubborn as you. I design for Kevin, Jon and Chris, not for myself and when I’m having a hard time solving a problem, I turn to them.

#### Your intuition vs Pro/Con lists

You all know that feeling in your gut when you’re just so sure about something. Our intuition is a tricky thing, it can lead you to amazing things or make you crash so hard. It’s important to learn how to control that feeling of storming blindly onwards.

I get this feeling often and when I do, I go with the solution that my gut tells me to, but before I go and show it excitedly to my teammates, I create a second solution. Then I compare them and write the pros and the cons of each solution. If you do it honestly, which of course you do (because we don’t play favourites in our designs) you will see clearly which is the best option. After you pick your winning option, it’s time to sell it, but this can be hard sometimes. So here’s a little advice I got from my father, “If you’re absolutely sure about it, say it until they hear you”. And I do that in my own subtle and delicate way…my boss can attest to that :)

#### Final Thoughts

We design experiences (hopefully good ones), so it really doesn’t matter what is the subject of the experience. Don’t be intimidated if you lack knowledge in certain areas or if you don’t fit the persona that a product is geared towards. Think if the project interests you, if it challenges you, because if an ex-ballerina can design a sports media platform, then there really are no limits :).
