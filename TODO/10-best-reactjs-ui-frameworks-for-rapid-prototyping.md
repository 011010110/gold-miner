I was researching for a few feature rich UI frameworks based on React; that give the power of composability through React components that you can directly plug in into your React project

Here is a compilation of a few ReactJS based UI frameworks (in no particular order), that I came across. Hope one of these choices will help you rapidly prototype your "ReactJS" ideas.

## Ant Design of React

[Bonus] Ant Design of React is a React framework from the Chinese company Ant Design; based on the design specifications they have come up for their projects. It features a "complete" set of beautiful UI components built with React, using Material Design principles.

They're looking for volunteers to make their english translations better/complete (the time picker component, for instance, needs translation). Take at look at [this issue](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/issues/1471), if you're interested.
