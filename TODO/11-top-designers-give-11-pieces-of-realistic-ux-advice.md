优秀的设计者是终生学习者。

在 [Springboard](http://springboard.com)，我们将用户体验以及数据科学的导师和学习者配对，这有助于我们听从前辈的意见。

在我们免费的[用户体验职业引导 - Guide to UX Careers](https://www.springboard.com/guide-to-ux-design-careers/) 中，我们汇总了许多领域内顶尖从业者的建议。

我们采访了11位厉害的用户体验设计师，询问了他们的设计灵感，并且也让他们给其他从业者提了一些用户体验方面的建议。

我们与 [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/) 的团队合作为你带来了以下的见解。

## 1\. [**Paul Boag**](https://twitter.com/boagworld)

作为一个网站设计代理商 [Headscape](http://headscape.co.uk/)(雀巢、麦克米伦、以及一些英国的大学都是他们的客户) 的联合创始人，Paul 从事网站相关工作已经二十多年了。他同时也是一个发表了大量作品的作家和演说家。

### **设计灵感**

我最喜欢的设计就是原始版本的[伦敦地铁图](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/29/4160028/harry-beck-designer-of-iconic-london-underground-map)。

这个设计突破了一些传统的约定，使得它具有如此的开创性。它抛弃了呈现真实距离和地点的约定，这样，他们就可以将复杂的地铁网络用非常简单的方式呈现出来。对我来说，这就是一个优秀的设计应该要做到的：从一个不同的角度切入以使用简单的方式去表达复杂的东西。

### **职业建议**

老实说，我绝对不会给年轻的我任何意见，因为我知道我一定不会听从。

即使我听从了，我也不会像我自己发现一样学到那么多。学习任何事的最好方法都是去犯错，所以我不希望让年轻的我失去这个机会。就像 Winston Churchill 曾经说过的：“成功就是从失败走向失败却不丧失热情。”

不要听从任何人，犯你自己的错，当你失败的时候，爬起来，再试一次。

### **设计灵感**

我最近发现了 [多邻国](https://www.duolingo.com/)，一个在线语言学习平台

我由于许多原因，非常喜欢它的用户体验。它的用户界面非常简洁、有趣且具有激励性。许多应用试图加入游戏性以及社区，只是因为这样做很酷，这最终导致这些功能就像是后来加入的。而多邻国在课程中完美运用游戏元素和变坏来吸引用户。

![image12](https://studio.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image12-1024x662.png)

我也很喜欢它的语言沉浸功能，用户可以在翻译上相互合作。记忆和重复是语言初学者总是要经历的阶段，但这总让人感到无趣。而多邻国在这方面的尝试非常有创意。

我总是觉得我们消费者应用的创新上已经到达了某种意义上的高处，所以还能见到一些很新鲜的同时也很合适的创意让人感到非常惊喜。

### **职业建议**

要知道在像用户体验这样需要合作的职业中，人远比技能重要。如果你有研究和设计的天分，你迟早都能学会这些技能。但是人际关系会很大程度上影响你职业的成败。

当我把最初的职业变成高科技的时候，我知道很少有人跟我在做一样的事。当我回到学校，在 Bentley University 学习人为因素工程（Human Factors）的时候，我感觉像是进入了一个全新的世界。当然，这很大程度上是由于学到的东西，但是我在那里遇到的人也非常有价值。

现在我依然在参与当地的用户体验专家协会（UXPA）分会活动，当我现在开始做独立咨询的时候，那个团体甚至变得更重要了。所以尽可能去与那些跟你一样对用户体验富有热情的人交流，并且去询问他们的意见。

## 3\. [**Mike Kus**](https://twitter.com/mikekus)

Mike 最初从事平面设计，之后转而做网站设计。他与 Twitter、微软、MailChimp 等公司合作，创造了许多兼顾形式和功能性的用户体验设计。

### **设计灵感**

[Hipopotam Studio](http://hipopotamstudio.pl)，我喜欢这个网站以及它纯粹的、富有创意和乐趣的用户界面。

![image13](https://studio.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image13-1024x525.png)

### **职业建议**

学会将用户界面趋势和实用的设计惯例分开。单单因为一种设计方式被广泛使用，不意味着这就是最好的方法。

## 4\. [**Jack Zerby**](https://twitter.com/jackzerby)

Jack 是 [Flavors.me](http://flavors.me/) 和 [Flavors.me](http://flavors.me/) 的联合创始人，[Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) 的前设计主管。Jack 说在它高中第一次启动 Phtoshop 时，就被设计吸引了，同时，他的父亲对他的影响也非常大。现在你可以在 [Workshop](https://thisisworkshop.com/)（一个年轻人的企业家培训项目） 上找到他

![image15](https://studio.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image15.png)

## **设计灵感**

我近来最喜欢的产品体验就是在城区中使用 [ParkMobile 应用](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sharewire.parkmobilev2&hl=en)

我再也不需要在附近花几十分钟的时间寻找熟食店换零钱来支付停车费了，我现在可以直接输入[停车计时表上的数字](http://parkitnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image_parkmobile_meter-279x300.png)，设定好预计的停车时间，然后在应用中直接支付停车费。当预计时间快要结束时，应用还会给我发来消息，如果我需要的话，可以直接加钱以延长停车时间。

![image18](https://studio.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image18.png)

流畅而且没有麻烦。

### **职业建议**

总是去考虑最终呈现给用户的结果以及用户所处的情境：用户需要在怎样的情境中完成哪些任务？

举个例子，我试图在我的车上安装一个自行车架，于是我访问了制造商的网站。我的目标是尽快安装好自行车架并行驶上路。我当前的情形是，我顶着大太阳站在车外，而我的孩子们都在哭，因为他们想要立刻到公园去。

设计的时候应时刻牢记，要试图去理解你的用户。就像是成功的营销一样，要去理解用户遇到的问题、挫折，并且使用他们能听懂的方式去交流。

不要去猜测或是落入设计者的傲慢（这是我们总是在做的）。

## 5\. [**Laura Klein**](https://twitter.com/lauraklein)

Laura 在硅谷做了15年的工程师和设计师。她的目标是帮助创业公司了解他们的用户，从而更快地做出更好的产品。她的书，[创业公司的用户体验 - UX for Lean Startups](http://www.amazon.com/UX-Lean-Startups-Experience-Research/dp/1449334911)，以及她的博客，[Users Know](http://usersknow.blogspot.com/)，都告诉了产品所有者他们在做研究和设计的时候，需要了解什么。

![image06](https://studio.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image062.png)

### **设计灵感**

用户体验设计师总是只注意到那些让我们感觉不舒服的设计，我想这大概是一种诅咒吧，又或者只有我是这样的。无论如何，我总是很喜欢任何简单的、与我的生活融为一体的、我甚至不去注意到的那些设计。

### **职业建议**

寻找两位导师。

第一位导师应该是一个在你关心的领域比你经验丰富并且具有影响力的人。他们会帮助你，给你一些观点，并且教会你被他们那样的人雇佣所必须的技能。

第二位导师应该是比你年长几岁的人。他们会教你做你想做的工作需要知道的东西。我不知道现在那些刚开始做科技相关工作的人的生活是怎么样的，但是我确定那些只要是已经做这个工作几年的人就会有非常深刻的理解。

所以，去寻找两个人：一个帮助你得到下一份工作的人和一个帮你做好下一份工作的人。

### **设计灵感**

User Experience surrounds us and extends far beyond the grasp of the digital web. User Experience as a label has to be seen through the perspective of context in designed interaction versus the actual medium or platform.
用户体验存在于我们生活中的方方面面，它已经远远超出数字网络的范围。

As an example, let’s take a look at automobiles in general.

It’s assumed that most of the time we spend in our vehicles we would be driving them. When we’re driving the priority, I hope, would be entirely based on the road in front of us. Stay in our lane. Stay under the speed limit. Watch out for other vehicles, pedestrians, or animals. But then we introduced a radio and thermostat. Looking away from the road for even a fraction of a second can lead to a lot of trouble for everyone on the road. So, why don’t the car manufacturers keep that in mind when designing the center consoles? Most have overly robust options, buttons, dials, and even touch screens to change the temperature or radio station.

If User Experience is about the context of interaction, then we need to look at how we can simplify the experience so the user’s primary focus isn’t negatively affected.  

Great design guides a user without requiring much thought. Confusion kills.

### **Career Advice**:

Be insatiable. Always be present. Don’t let a label define you or what you look to accomplish in life. Look to everyone and everything for answers even when they don’t seem to relate to the question at hand. You can be anything and everything you want to be.

## 7\. [**Kevin M. Hoffman**](https://twitter.com/kevinmhoffman)

His clients include Harvard University, Nintendo, and MTV. You can find him on his [website](http://kevinmhoffman.com/), and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kevinmhoffman).

![image04](https://studio.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image044.png)

### **Design Inspiration**:

I’m a big fan of the overall user experience of the stock or “Google Play” version of Android, and more recently Android Wear.

I experimented with the possible switch to Android for awhile when the “[Kit Kat](http://www.android.com/kitkat/)” version of the software and the Nexus 5 came out, and I haven’t looked back since. There’s a lot of interface choices that I think are great, but my favorite things are anticipatory and in the [microinteraction](http://microinteractions.com/) space, such as the different ways you can act with push notifications, or seamless integration with calendaring user needs.

![image03](https://studio.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image035.jpg)

The first time I realized I could let people know I was running late for a meeting with two clicks/touches, I was like “Whoa! That’s useful.” Recently, I’ve been integrating the Android Wear watch, and it only took me about five days for that to become a completely natural part of my life. Now I can fade out of social situations by constantly looking at my watch instead of pulling my phone out of my pocket to check and interact with notifications.

I’m very much looking forward to Android Auto as well. We’ll see what the next iOS is like, but for the time being, I can’t see myself switching back  


### **Career Advice**:

“Hey younger self!

You will spend some time idealizing long term goals, and that’s a good exercise. You’ll think about your ideal job, employer, lifestyle, family, and more. But in reality, you’ll get very little satisfaction chasing those things, and you should never wait around for them.

Spend life living.

The most fun is in charting the actual, sometimes smaller (sometimes not) decisions that will confront you whether you want them to or not. Your goal should be getting better at making decisions when they can have the greatest impact on your life, and not any particular ideal.  
Also, as much as you can, realize that self-doubt may help you with humility, but not much else. Don’t take yourself too seriously.  Exercise more, because dude, what have you done to me? Also, don’t overuse the word ‘also’.”

### Design Inspiration:

One of my biggest inspirations lately has been public space design in large cities, like New York City, where I live.

I can’t help but notice not just how well designed the larger spaces like Central Park are, but also how convenient smaller spaces are available to the public wherever I look. I also find myself obsessed with watching people use parks, and the fields and courts within them. The reason I look to this ecosystem for inspiration is because in order to make these spaces successful one has to design for the experience of such a large, varied group of people to enjoy, what can be, such an overwhelming and crowded space.

![image16](https://studio.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image16.png)

This, to me, is the aim of architecting for a User’s Experience, allowing them to flow, how they decide, through a space, to get an intended result that is pleasing both to the user, as well as to the product owner or designer.

###   
**Career Advice:**

Chill out, for starters.

One thing about being in our field is that we know the importance of our work, and we want everyone else to know that importance and “get it”. So, many times we find ourselves fighting tooth and nail to get the message out there.

This, of course, leads to exhaustion and deflation. What I’ve realized is that fighting so very hard to imbue my knowledge on those outside of our field is not the point. I’ve also learned that it really doesn’t matter if the business, or the technology team, or whomever “get” what I do at the deepest level.

All that matters is that you are passionate about what you can control, do what you are responsible for (and more if necessary) to see that passion come to life, and that you enjoy the ride as you go!

### **Design Inspiration**:

Dropbox continues to rule in UX – the app is very seamless.

Good UX design should appear to be invisible. Dropbox impresses me with the onboarding experience, attention to detail, and thinking differently rather than copying patterns to make it completely intuitive. 

### **Career Advice**:

Document everything!

Having an extensive reference of well ordered UX design to browse through helps you learn and also find solutions to problems as your reference builds. Remember to document real-world experiences too, these patterns can be referenced too.  


## 10**.** [**Pavel Macek**](https://twitter.com/pavel_macek)

Currently a Product Designer for [Slack](http://slack.com), Pavel says that he ‘does give a sh*it about people’, and this  translates into his work – designing and building delightful things enjoyed by many. Follow him [here](https://twitter.com/pavel_macek).

![image19](https://studio.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image19.png)

### **Design Inspiration**:

For me, one great example of UX design is Technics turntable SL-1200, which has been sold for 35 years without major modifications. It’s still the most popular turntable for DJs, producers and musicians.

![image07](https://studio.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image072-1024x697.png)

It demonstrates functional design at its best and the importance of coupling thoughtful design with precise execution. I think that the ensuring the best possible execution is very often forgotten part of a UX designer’s responsibility, but it ultimately defines the success of the product.

### **Career Advice**:

Don’t get lost in all the  design methodologies and design patterns. It’s important to learn about design frameworks and have rigid design process, but the start is always very simple: Who am I designing this for? What does he need to achieve? How can I help him to achieve that?

Then it’s just a matter of iteration and learning what works and what doesn’t.

## 11**.** [**Robert Fabricant**](https://twitter.com/fabtweet)

Robert specializes in design for health-care and social innovation. He recently led [Project Masiluleke](http://www.poptech.org/project_m), an initiative that harnesses the power of mobile technology to combat HIV/AIDS in South Africa. He has previously held the position of Fellow at the prestigious global agency [frog design](http://www.frogdesign.com/). He also [teaches](http://about.tisch.nyu.edu/object/FabricantR.html)**,** gives talks, and [writes](http://www.fastcodesign.com/user/robert-fabricant).

![image09](https://studio.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image091.jpg)

### **Inspiration**:

I am continually inspired, provoked and challenged by the [NYC subway system](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1665022/why-does-interaction-design-matter-lets-look-at-the-evolving-subway-experience) as an amazing, multi-faceted user experience.

I have been a subway rider for (at least) 45 years. You can’t truly know or appreciate the value of an experience unless you have lived with it, and lived with it over an extensive period of time.

Too many of the user experiences we celebrate are transient – apps that will likely not be in our phone in another month much less year. The subways are here to stay, and improvements are measured in pixels, people and steel. This sort of design is slow hard work.

![image00](https://studio.uxpin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image009-1024x602.png)

Yet change is constant. As a resident of NYC there are few systems that are more important to “learn” than the subway. But where does the experience begin and end? It is not simply contained in the stations, trains and turnstiles.

In recent years the subway system has become a platform for experimentation, both authorized and improvised. Recently, large touch-screen information displays have started popping up on the Union Square platform. It is fascinating to watch people interact with them for the first time, peeling back one more layer on an experience that connects so many of us together in this great city (yes it is my home town).

As UX designers we should be thinking – and crafting – experiences on a big scale. What better than a city, where data and mobility are beautifully intertwined, and where we can constantly explore (and enjoy) the seams between our own experiences and those around us?

### **Career Advice**:

I love to talk to designers about the first moment that you put your design in front of a person to explore, experience and (hopefully) enjoy.

In that one moment, even before the person actually engages with the artifact, you always see it differently. It is like the old expression about the ‘scales falling from your eyes’. You suddenly see (and know) so many things that were just outside your understanding, planning and intuition.

Those moments are precious – very, very precious – as well as humbling for every designer, no matter how accomplished.

Design is not precious in comparison, so try to make as many of these moments as possible happen on your projects. You don’t need to ask for permission!

Working at [frog](http://www.frogdesign.com/) for 13 years, I had the pleasure of being in those situations over and over again with many different teams – Close Encounters of the Design Kind.

Quality is always, and only, measured in the response the artifact elicits – in how it engages, delights and supports the user.

[Behavior is our medium](http://www.ixda.org/resources/robert-fabricant-behavior-our-medium). Never forget it.
