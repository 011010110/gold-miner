*“How do I get better at visual design?”*   
我怎样才能提高视觉设计呢？

This question comes up a lot. I coach and mentor a lot of students on product design: tutoring for the Academy of Art in San Francisco, reviewing for AIGA Portfolio Day, hosting interns at Facebook and so on.  
这个问题有很多人困惑。我产品设计方面是一位导师，并且辅导了很多学生，比如在圣弗朗西斯科艺术学院担任导师，在AIGA Portfolio Day作为产品复审，Facebook的实习生辅导等。

There’s a bridge from a student’s perspective to a professional’s perspective. For most it’s guaranteed to be a blend of fear and excitement and curiosity, peppered with a lot of questions.
初学者在成为专业产品设计师的观念之间大部分需要通过这样一座桥，它由敬畏+激情+好奇心和满腹的疑问组成。

*“What’s going to happen when I get out?”*  
*“我毕业后会何去何从？”*

*“What kind of design jobs are out there?”*  
*“设计相关的工作都有什么？”*

*“What might I be a good fit for?”*  
*“我适合做什么样的工作？”*

*“What if I don’t get a job?”*  
*“如果我找不到工作怎么办？”*

*“WHAT IF THERE ARE NO JOBS?”*  
*“如果根本没有工作招聘怎么办？”*

*“What can I do now to prepare?”*  
*“我能为找工作准备些什么？”*

We recently hosted a [critique at Facebook](https://medium.com/facebook-design/peek-inside-a-facebook-design-critique-c4833efda26e#.4qt02buac) with a student from Cornell, [Jon Lee](https://medium.com/@jonleenj). There’s something that I really liked about Jon in our brief interaction. He’s self-aware. He already knows that he’s got room to improve in terms of visual design. He knows this because he’s gotten feedback on this from potential employers, and he — like many other students on the brink of their careers — is curious how his skills will prepare him for a design role. He wants to know how he can get better.   
最近，我们在[Facebook举办了一场自我评论](https://medium.com/facebook-design/peek-inside-a-facebook-design-critique-c4833efda26e#.4qt02buac)，其中有一位来自康奈尔大学的学生[Jon Lee](https://medium.com/@jonleenj)。在我们为数不多的互动中，他身上有一些东西我很欣赏。那就是他的自我认知。他了解自己在视觉设计上有哪些需要提高的地方。他有如此清晰地自我认知，归功于他从潜在的雇主身上获取的反馈，就像很多即将面临开始职业生涯的同学一样，好奇作为一个设计师需要什么样的技能。他想知道怎样才能做得更好一点。

Being a solid product designer requires a broad skillset, and having visual chops is a big part of this role, particularly at Facebook. I’m excited that Jon is curious about this piece, and if I were able to pull him aside now, I’d ask Jon the same questions that I ask other students and give him a framework that hopefully will serve beyond this project.  
成为一个设计老司机需要广泛的技能，具备visual chops是很重要的，尤其是在Facebook。令我兴奋的是，Jon在这方面很好奇，如果他现在在我身边，我会问Jon我问过很多同学的一些问题，然后给他一个框架，希望能够在这个这个项目之外对他有所帮助。

Here’s a quick look at the designs Jon shared. At this point, he was just beginning to look at visual design.   
这里有一个Jon分享的设计作品概览。从这里开始他才是真正的在视觉设计的道路上踏上正轨。

Nearspace app design concept by Jon Lee   
Jon Lee为应用Nearspace设计的概念图。

We often refer to visual design as craft and execution at Facebook. In order to evaluate the current state of Jon’s work and encourage him towards well-crafted design, I need to ask questions. Inquiry should come before judgement, because it broadens the understanding of someone’s intentionality.    
在Facebook，我们经常将视觉设计的评判标准分为工艺和执行力。为了能够评估Jon这个作品的水平，并且鼓励他向技艺精湛的设计大师的程度迈进，我需要在评价他的作品之前向他提问和调查，因为这样更好地了解了别人的设计意图。

### What is your type hierarchy?  
你的层次结构是什么?

- Have you audited your type styles? I see two casings (Title Case and UPPERCASE), at least three different type sizes, two colors of type, centered and left aligned type.
- 你修改过你的设计风格么？我看到了两个风格（标题的大小写问题），至少三种大小类型、两种颜色、还有居中和左对齐两种类型。
- What styles belong with headers? Which ones for buttons? Which ones for body copy? For metadata?
- header风格是哪一种？按钮的风格是什么？body copy的风格呢？metadata呢？

- I see two different list styles. One more clearly relates to existing discovery patterns (photo with business name, categories, and star rating) and one that looks like a wireframe (Recent Posts).
- 我看到两个不同的列表样式。一个显然是关于实时的发现模式（照片和业务名称、类别和星级），另一个看起来像一个线框(最近的发布的)。
- What is the difference between buttons and lists? On the Profile page, cards, buttons and lists are using the same white background with grey outline pattern. Should they be different?
- 列表和按钮的设计风格有什么区别？在概要文件页面，卡片、按钮和列表是使用相同的白色背景，灰色轮廓样式。他们应该设计成不同的风格么？

### How does this compare to existing or established patterns?  
### 这种设计样式和现有的或已经发布的样式哪家强？

- If the selections are toggles, could they automatically toggle on? Are Cancel and Apply necessary?
- 如果选项能够切换，那么他们会自动切换么？取消和应用有必要么？
- Is Back the same as Cancel? Would an X in the top right corner suffice?  
- 点击返回和点击取消是一样的么？把右上角换成X可以么？
- I see there’s a Reset button without any filters applied. Is it necessary in this state? Could Apply replace Reset?   
- 我看到有一个重置按钮没有起到任何过滤的作用。有必要在这种情况下添加这个按钮么？应用按钮能够取代重置按钮么？
- Should the bottom nav stay put in this part of the experience?

### What are your margins and padding rules?  
### 你的margin（外边距）和padding(内边距)的规范是什么？

- I see minimal margins on the Nearby and Profile screens; Filter has much more generous margins.
- 我从附近页面和资料页面看到很多细微的外边距；过滤功能更具有明显的外边距。
- The “y” in Nearby in the bottom nav nearly touches the edge of the screen.
- 在附近页面的竖直方向的地步导航几乎贴近了屏幕的边缘。
- What is your grid?
- 为什么不用网格布局？

### Are your icons clear?   
### 你的icon表达出想要呈现的意思么？

- I see a single seat icon and clusters of 3 and of 6. Is that a count of seats or an approximation or a range? Would there be a better way to represent this? Is this the equivalent of “good for groups”? Is there another way to show this?
- 我看到一个座位图标有的是单个，有的是三个或者六个的聚集在一起。这是一个座位的计数还是一些座位数的大约值？又或者是一系列的座位么？有没有一个更好的方式来设计表达这个含义？这是“团购”优惠的意思么？有没有另一种方式设计它？
- Why is there no iconic equivalent to the opposite of outlet? If something is not important, why would you have to indicate that lack of importance; wouldn’t initial results include all available options?
- 为什么没有明显的标志表示两个相反的意思？如果不是重要的元素，为什么你要显示出来这种无足轻重的元素？初步结果难道不应该包含所有可用的选项么？
- Does pie mean pie? Or desserts? Or food? Does the cup mean drinks? Could you assume that every food place serves drinks as well? Are there better groupings here?
- Pie(派，一种食物)在这里是想表达pie(派)？还是指代甜点？又或是代指所有食物？杯饮料意味着什么？你是假设认为每个餐厅都能够提供饮料吗?有更好的分组吗?

### How consistent are your design choices?
### 你的选择设计风格的一致么？

- I see distance using a dropdown while other filtering choices are buttons.
- 我看到在使用下拉过滤功能时，有一些过滤按钮选项的样式有一些不同。
- Some buttons contain icons and other contain text.
- 一些只有icon的按钮，而一些按钮只有文字。
- One icon uses perspective, while the others don’t. The wifi icon has the thickest lines; the outlet the thinnest. Some are pixelated; some are not. Some are black; some are grey.
- 一个按钮有角度，然而其他没有。wifi图标的线很粗；但是插线板的线很细。有些像素化，有的则不是。一些是黑色的，又有一些是灰色的。

- Most of the cards and buttons are using the same pattern: corner radius, outline, color fill, type. Are they *too *consistent?
- 大多数的卡片和按钮拥有同样的样式：角弧度，轮廓，填充颜色，风格。他们是不是 *过于 *一致？

### Does everything on the screen need to be there?
### 屏幕上所有的元素都是必要的么？

- I see a divider above the search field and dividers under each Availability choice.
- 在搜索区域上方有一个分割线，还有每一个可选选项下方也有一个分割线。
- I see one use of the color green.
- 有一个使用了绿色
- I see both icons and text in the nav. Are both necessary?

### How would you define your color palette?

- The palette is pretty muted. It’s warm in tone, excepting a brighter green button. Do you have rules around what to use where?

![](http://ac-Myg6wSTV.clouddn.com/eabacd8b944dffa24c68.jpeg)

### Is your spelling, grammar, and punctuation correct? Have you considered content strategy?

- I’m familiar with Nearby and Profile in the bottom nav; what does Add mean? Add what?
- “Availability” is misspelled.
- Is the word Availability necessary?
- How does the flow of the page “read” (be it through words or visuals)? Your page title is Filter, and your section headers are Distance, Seating Availability, Wifi Availability, Outlet Availability, and Food/Beverage Availability. How would you describe what you can do on this page to a friend? Are these constructed in the right hierarchy? Are they named correctly?

![](http://ac-Myg6wSTV.clouddn.com/26652ca0f75030a68f5e.jpeg)

### How would this translate to another platform?

- If you designed this for an Android device or for desktop, would you make the same above decisions? What design decisions would you make differently?

How do I get better at visual design?

*Having* answers to these posed questions is an excellent place to start. Being a good designer—being a good *visual* designer — requires intentionality. That means that you’re thinking through these questions and answering them as you’re making design decisions, not only when someone asks you the question after the fact.

The next thing to work on as you answer these questions *with intentionality*, is to ensure that intentionality is based on solid design principles and research and attention to detail, and yes, sometimes things like style and preference. This can be tricky, because not every designer has these sensibilities or well-founded opinions yet. And that’s okay, because the path to improving this begins by understanding that your work isn’t quite there yet.

Ira Glass has fantastic [perspective](https://vimeo.com/85040589) on this:

> “Nobody tells people who are beginners — and I really wish somebody had told this to me — is that all of us who do creative work … we get into it because we have good taste. But it’s like there’s a gap, that for the first couple years that you’re making stuff, what you’re making isn’t so good, OK? It’s not that great. It’s really not that great. It’s *trying* to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it’s not quite that good. But your *taste* — the thing that got you into the game — your taste is still killer, and your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you’re making is kind of a disappointment to you, you know what I mean?”

If you have taste, and that taste tells you that you have room for improvement, you can improve your visual design. How?

**You observe design in the world and form opinions** on what’s good and what’s not good. You solidify your opinions on foundational design principles.

**You look at established design systems** like material design and Human Interface Guidelines.

**You practice.**

**You browse websites and apps** and Dribbble for excellent design work, and you **don’t** copy them, but you ask yourself *why *is this working? You search for answers.

**And you practice.**

**You show your work to people who have the sensibilities**—the visual design skills—already, and you listen to the questions they have about your work, and you think about your intentionality behind them, and you find your answers.

**And you ask yourself questions** like the ones we just went through.

Now, I could have given Jon reactions, things like “your styles are all over the place” or “that green button feels out of place.” I could have also prescribed solutions like “left align all your filter categories and buttons” or “make the corner radius of your buttons smaller” or “choose a brighter brand color.” But if Jon wants to get better, if *you *want to get better, it takes more than polishing a single project.

Feedback and mentorship can be very similar; the best development usually comes from asking questions and guiding rather than being prescriptive.
Improvement takes practice. The proven ability to execute again and again is what gets students that first design role, and once that first role is landed it’s the self-awareness and the progress that point towards a trajectory of growth.
